This is a custom bash script I use to provision a new Ubuntu Destop. You can read more about it [here](https://www.justinsloan.com/2022/05/how-i-provision-a-fresh-linux-install).

*Use extreme caution before executing a bash script from a third party.*

    sudo wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justinsloan/ubuntu-provision/main/provision.sh | sudo bash
